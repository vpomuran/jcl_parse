# JCLPARSE

## Overview

`jcl_parse.py` is a utility script for parsing Juniper Cloud Lab  output window. It maps device names to hostnames using a set of rules and generates configuration files for use with Ansible (`host_vars` YAML files) or SSH (`ssh_config`).

This tool is useful for JCL environments where devices are dynamically assigned SSH ports and you need to automate the generation of inventory or SSH configuration for automation or access.

---

## Features

- **Parse JCL output** to extract device SSH forwarding information.
- **Map devices to hostnames** using a rule-based mapping file.
- **Generate Ansible host_vars YAML files** for each mapped host.
- **Generate or update an SSH config file** (`ssh_config`) with host entries.
- **Update only relevant entries** in an existing `ssh_config` file.

---

## Usage

### Command Line

```sh
python3 jcl_parse.py <jcl_file> <output_dir> [ini_file] [-ssh]
```

- `<jcl_file>`: Input file containing JCL output with port forwarding info.
- `<output_dir>`: Directory where output files will be written.
- `[ini_file]`: (Optional) Mapping rules file (default: `output2host.ini`).
- `-ssh`: If specified, output will be written to a single `ssh_config` file instead of YAML files.

### Examples

#### Generate Ansible YAML files

```sh
python3 jcl_parse.py jcl_output.txt output_dir
```

This will create YAML files for each host in `output_dir/host_vars/`.

#### Generate or update SSH config

```sh
python3 jcl_parse.py jcl_output.txt output_dir -ssh
```

This will create or update `output_dir/ssh_config` with the mapped hosts.

## Mapping Rules File (`output2host.ini`)

This file defines how device names are mapped to hostnames. Each line should be:

```
<regex> <order> <hostname>
```

- `<regex>`: Regular expression to match device names.
- `<order>`: The Nth match for this regex.
- `<hostname>`: The hostname to assign.

Example:

```
deviceA 1 host1
deviceB 2 host2
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`)

---

## Notes

- Existing `ssh_config` entries are preserved unless a mapped host is updated.
- Only the relevant SSH config entries are changed or added.
- The script prints the mapping and output actions for transparency.
